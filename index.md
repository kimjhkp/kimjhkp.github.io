## About me

---

 __Flu immunologist__ and __computational biologist__.  

I use various computational and statistical tools to understand and answer research questions in immunology and infectious diseases and participated in many different research projects including bench-side animal research to computational genomics projects. 

During my last project, I worked in an interdisciplinary team environment where
scientists with different skill sets (including physicists and biologist) worked together to achieve a common goal.

## My passion 

---

Coming from an infectious disease biology background, I have a vast interest in global prevention of infections. Due to the fast growing nature of human population, the risk of zoonosis is increasing rapdily. 

I am passionate to be engaged in a scientific program where data-driven approach can be utilized to understand global infectious diseases and facilitate a development of vaccines.

I highly value an interdisciplinary environment and believe in effective communication for better collaboration. 

[ Also a hobby programmer / developer : ) ]

## Previous projects

1. __Influenza:__ Understanding the progress of symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza infections using a data-driven approach utilizing single-cell RNA-seq and advanced 3D tissue imaging

2. __Influenza vaccines:__ Understanding how and why individuals respond to influenza vaccines differently by utilizing human transcriptome data. 

3. __Lung fibrosis__: Utilizing an intravital imaging to understand how immune cells in the lung are regulated in homeostasis to prevent a spontaneous formation of lung fibrosis.
